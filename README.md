# junit-integration-test
An example of how one could dynamically set configuration for integration tests depending on Maven profile.
(dev, test, qa and stage). The code makes use of Maven filtering and JUnits @Rule.

Included is creation of:
- DataSources for injection in EJB:s.
- Configuration f√∂r remote REST-service. Tests with for example REST-assured
- Input test data that is dependent on which test-environment that the integration test is performed.

Example of usage of how to set a 

public class DataSourceInjectionTest {

	@InjectTestResource(getFactory = DataSourceFactory.class, getMethod = DataSourceFactoryMethod.ACCOUNT)
	public static DataSourceImpl accountDataSource;

	@ClassRule
	public static final TestResourcesRule TEST_RESOURCES_RULE = new TestResourcesRule(DataSourceInjectionTest.class);

	@Test
	public void createAccountDataSource() {
	  //A real test could include instatiation of EJB that uses data source
	  //MyService myService = new MyService(accountDataSource);
	  //assertNotNull(myService.getSomeDataFromDataSource())
	  
		assertNotNull(accountDataSource);
		System.out.println(accountDataSource);

	}
}

In a module using junit-integration-test I'd rekommend 
- placing integration tests in src/integration-test, add that folder as a test resource
- use Maven Failsafe plugin for integration tests
- name integrations tests according to Maven standard *IT.java

How to use:
- Clone repository
- mvn install

How to run integrations tests for various test environments
-  mvn verify -P dev-env-it 
-  mvn verify -P test-env-it
-  mvn verify -P qa-env-it
